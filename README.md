## Overview
For the enjoyment of music fans, this dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of global music trends from 2010 to 2019. Through interactive visualizations and data exploration tools, users can explore questions related to genre popularity, artist trends, and feature correlations. The dashboard uses data collected by Billboard and Spotify to give users insights into what influences music trends. It also serves as a platform for finding new music and tracking how different musical genres have changed over the last ten years. With features such as an interactive word cloud, genre word bank, heatmap, scatter plot, and customizable dropdown menus, the dashboard allows users to analyze the dynamics of the music industry.

## Building Process
Throughout the process of building this dashboard, I used various concepts to analyze and visualize the music industry trends effectively from my dataset. I began by cleaning the dataset which involved handling missing values, fixing minor errors, and transforming variables as needed. The exploratory data analysis done during an assignment also helped me gain insights into the dataset's structure and identify patterns. One of the key features of the dashboard is the word cloud visualization, which requires text preprocessing techniques to handle artist names and genre labels. I was able to explore the properties of the WordCloud library and use it to generate the word cloud and applied color mapping based on genre to enhance user readability. Additionally, I utilized a heatmap to complete correlation analysis and explore relationships between different features in the dataset. Using Dash, I included interactive graphs, range sliders, and dropdown menus so that users could modify their analysis and look into specific parts of the data. Lastly, I made sure that users could efficiently navigate and understand the visualizations by optimizing the dashboard's design for a seamless user experience. Overall, the process involved a combination of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques to create an informative and user-friendly dashboard for exploring music industry trends.

## Strengths and Learning Experiences
As I work to improve my Python skills, I have been actively participating in practical assignments and investigating different methods for statistical analysis. I have developed the skill to effectively navigate a range of datasets throughout this class, gaining knowledge that is essential for making educated choices. In addition to improving my problem-solving abilities, this process of acquiring and applying knowledge has given me the flexibility to take on new challenges in the constantly evolving field of data science!
